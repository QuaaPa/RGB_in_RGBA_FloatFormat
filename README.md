# RGB_in_RGBA_FloatFormat
this is a very fast repository, at least useful for me, written in haste to convert rgb to rgb format, this application will be useful to anyone who needs a specific color in float format 

You can use this website https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp

**EXAMPLE: (RGB)120, 108, 178 = (RGBA)0.470588, 0.423529, 0.698039, 1.0**
